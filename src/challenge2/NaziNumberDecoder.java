/**
 * Challenge 2 of the Tuenti Challenge 2018. This program is about decoding a
 * set of characters that are written in an arbitrary base, those characters
 * represent a number.
 * 
 * We know that all digits in the base are present only ONE TIME in the String.
 * For example, for a string of length 3, depending on the characters we could
 * the numbers 102, 120, 210 and 201 in an arbitrary base (we don't take leading
 * zeroes).
 * 
 * However, the aim of this challenge is not to know which number the string
 * represents, but to represent the difference between the minimum and maximum
 * values that the numbers in the string can be.
 * 
 * So, the first thing we have to do is to discover the arbitrary base. The
 * first approach was, depending on the first letter, the position in the
 * alphabet. However, this was not the solution. Nevertheless, if we try with
 * the length of the string as the base, voila!, we get the correct results.
 * 
 * For getting the minimum number we have to start in 1, followed by 0 and then
 * 2, 3... until reaching the base - 1. On the other hand, for the maximum
 * number we have to start by the base -1 and decrease.
 * 
 * The only difficulty was to show the big numbers, such as 26 powered 26.
 * However, we made use of BigInteger.
