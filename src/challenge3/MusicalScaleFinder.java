/**
 * The aim of this program is to calculate the possible scales in where a
 * musical piece can be played. However, we only use the minor and major scales.
 * 
 * Besides, the scales are ordered according to the scale where they belong and
 * if they represent a scale starting with a sharp note.
 * 
 * First, we have to consider the notes not by it's name, but to assign them a
 * double value that represent their position in the scale. If they have a sharp
 * modification, they will have 0.5 more of value, and, if they have a flat
 * modification, they will have 0.5 less of value. For this aim we created the
 * Musical Note enumerator.
 * 
 * For example, the A note, has a value of 0, but the A# has a value of 0.5 and
 * the Ab has a value of -0.5, but we consider the notes as a cycle, so it will
 * represent 6 - 0.5 = 5.5, the G# note. That's the reason we don't need to
 * represent the flat notes.
 * 
 * Second, according to the double values of the notes, we can represent a scale
 * as a double array, by setting the difference between the positions of the
 * pattern that each scale follows. For this aim we created the Musical Scale
 * enumerator.
 * 
 * For example, the Major scale has a pattern of "WWHWWWH", so from the first to
 * the second position there is a difference of 1, from the 3 to the 4 of 0.5
 * and so on. The double value array will be { 0, 1, 2, 2.5, 3.5, 4.5, 5.5 }).
 * 
 * Finally, for each note of the musical piece we have to calculate the possible
 * scales where it can be played. Finally, we intersect those result in a smart
 * way.
